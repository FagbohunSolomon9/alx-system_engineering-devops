a script that creates an alias
a script that prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user
The path to success is to take massive, determined action
If the path be beautiful, let us not ask where it leads
a script that lists environment variables
a script that lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions
a script that creates a new local variable
 a script that creates a new global variable
Every addition to true knowledge is an addition to human power
a script that prints the result of POWER divided by DIVIDE, followed by a new line
Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath
